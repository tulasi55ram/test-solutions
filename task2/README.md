## modern JavaScript frameworks 

Regarding modern JavaScript frameworks, I have extensive experience with React.js and its ecosystem, encompassing React hooks, Redux for state management, React Router for routing, Code Splitting and Lazy Loading, and Material UI. Additionally, I've utilized modern frontend frameworks like Next.js and Gatsby.js in previous roles.

In the domain of backend development, I've contributed to projects implementing microservices architecture, leveraging the CQRS design pattern for one of the application. Specifically, I've employed Node.js with the Express.js framework to develop RESTful APIs and have also worked with serverless lambda functions. Some applications utilized an event-driven architecture using pgboss as a queue management system.

Regarding databases, I've worked with both SQL and NoSQL solutions, including PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch.

While my current company doesn't prioritize Test-Driven Development (TDD), I have previous experience following a TDD approach using JEST and the React Testing Library. Additionally, I've utilized Cypress.js for end-to-end testing in previous projects.
